    𖹭 This is a simple console-based Bank Management System implemented in C# that allows users to manage up to 5 bank accounts. 
    The program stores account numbers and balances in two separate arrays and offers functionalities for creating accounts, depositing, withdrawing, and checking account balances. 
    Users can perform multiple operations using a loop-based menu until they choose to exit.

**𝙵𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜**
_Create an Account:_
    𖹭 Users can create up to 5 bank accounts with an initial balance of 0.
    Each account is assigned a unique account number.
_Deposit Money:_
    𖹭 Users can deposit money into an account by entering the account number and the amount.
    The program checks if the account exists and validates the deposit amount.
_Withdraw Money:_
    𖹭 Users can withdraw money from an account by entering the account number and the withdrawal amount.
    The program verifies that the account exists and checks if the balance is sufficient for the withdrawal.
_Check Balance:_
    𖹭 Users can check the current balance of any existing account by entering the account number.
    
**Multiple Operations:**
    𖹭 The program runs in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple actions (create, deposit, withdraw, check balance) until they choose to exit.
    
**Input Validation:**
    𖹭 Ensures valid account numbers and positive values for deposits and withdrawals.
    Prevents withdrawals from accounts with insufficient funds.
